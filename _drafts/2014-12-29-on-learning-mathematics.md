On my last birthday, in September, I gifted myself a huge set of mathematics
books. All of them very carefully chosen. For past 4 years or so, I have been trying to get back into
learning math. And when I say "learning",
I don't mean memorizing a bunch of formulas and spewing them out as
required. No. What I wanted to do was really understand all the
magical stuff that math seems to promise. Ever since I could
understand them, I have always enjoyed precise yet magical theories of
math and physics. Although, I never really understood them.
