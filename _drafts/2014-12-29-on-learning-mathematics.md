Sometime around the end of year 2000, just before the most important[^1]
two years of my school-time were about to start, my father bought me a
new computer, with internet connection. Up until then, I had been the
top student all the schools I had attended, for 10 straight
years.


[^1]: Important by the Indian schooling standards. As I found out later on, they
just don't really matter. The Indian education system is completely
screwed up.
