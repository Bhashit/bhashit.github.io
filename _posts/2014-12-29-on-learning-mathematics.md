On my last birthday, in September, I gifted myself a big stack of
mathematics books. All of them very carefully chosen. For past 4 years
or so, I have been trying to get back into learning math. And when I
say "learning", I don't mean memorizing a bunch of formulas and
spewing them out as required. No. What I wanted to do was really
understand all the magical stuff that math seems to promise. Ever
since I could understand them, I have been both fascinated and awed by
mathematics (and physics).

Maybe that awe is the reason I didn't start putting more efforts into
learning math sooner; thinking that the field is just too exotic and
hard to be studied in part time. Well, it might be if you want to
become a professional mathematician. I don't. It's more like a hobby
for me; and if it helps me professionally, all the better.

With that, I started learning math sometime in 2010. A few hours every
week. That petered out in about 3 months. After that, sometime in
2012, I read a post by Steve Yegge, titled
[Math Every Day][Math-Every-Day] and decided to try that strategy. At
least half an hour everyday for math. Considering that I was giving
too much time to my job, this too was ill fated and after a few weeks,
I was back to no-math. And there were several occasions when I took up
math on a weekend thinking that I would do it every weekend. After one
or two weekends, it just never happened.

The single biggest factor that was getting in the way was the fact
that I was trying to dive head first into math. Doing a lot of
exercises and learn everything about the given topic. Unless that's
your full time occupation, that is just never going to work out. It
leads to the frustrating feeling that you are getting nowhere.

A few months ago, I was getting desperate to get back into math. But
this time, I decided to try out a different strategy. One that I have
been using successfully for a lot of other things, but for some
reason, never applied it to learning math. The strategy was to take
math like a hobby that it is. Not getting caught up in too many
details at once. The strategy works something like this:

1. Get a lot of books, including the paper ones if possible.
2. Find online resources, including videos and articles.
3. From all of the above, pick whichever one that catches your fancy
   at the moment and start reading/watching.
4. If at any point, if you get tired or bored, pick something else, or
   just go wild on Google.
5. It's okay to learn things that are only tangential to math, like
   the history of math, or the story of prominent mathematicians.

Just around the same time I was beginning to apply this strategy, I
came across a post titled
["Mathematicians are Chronically lost and confused"][mathemaicians-lost]. It
said that all of the things that I had concluded were okay. Getting lost
and confused while getting into a large and seemingly infinite
field. Then, to top all of these things off, I found another gem by
Steve Yegge. This one was titled
["Math For Programmers"][math-for-programmers]. I added the points
suggested by Steve to my strategy. That post says pretty much every
thing I could have said in this post. It's just amazing.

I am a freelance programmer. I have a couple of friends who do
freelance work and we get together on a regular basis, sometime to
work together, sometime just to hang out. I knew that both of them
were interested in math so I suggested this strategy to them and we
decided to put aside at least 4 hours every week for math. Now comes
the reason for writing this post. *The strategy works*. Just like it
worked for Steve Yegge, it worked for three ordinary programmers like
us. It's been about 4 months and we are even more motivated than we
were at the beginning. Math has now become a habit.

In September, I shared all the resources with them. We don't do it
like a class. I did suggest some possible pathways for learning, but
all of us do it at our own pace and liking. Now, we get together every
week. And every week, we exceed our quota of 4 hours; sometimes
by 5-6 hours. We are having a lot of fun.

In the process, I have gained a lot of confidence. I know that I am
never going to learn everything about math, but I *will* be able to
know a *lot of* useful and amazing stuff.

## Why Do Programmers Need Math

If you read those Steve Yegge posts I mentioned above, I guess you
might have seen enough to answer that question. However, I still want
to present two arguments that are not apparent in his articles.

### Math is literally everywhere

Pretty much all the technologies that make our lives better are either
aided by math or exist because of it. Let me try to give a few
examples.

Every single time you do anything that involves the use of encryption,
math is involved. More specifically, it's
[number theory][number-theory]. Every time you log in to facebook, buy
something on amazon, send a message on WhatsApp, do online banking, or
send money on PayPal, math is at work, making them secure. The basic
ideas behind this math are not that hard to understand.

When those [CDN][cdn] services deliver the content to you, the most
likely candidate for optimizing that experience is
[graph theory][graph-theory]. Pretty much all of the popular services,
including facebook, Apple iTunes store, Microsoft, Rackspace, Adobe,
NASA, Yahoo, Airbnb etc. use CDNs to deliver data faster to you.

The reason Google (and now pretty much every search engine now) is so
successful at finding relevant result is the use of
[graph theory][graph-theory] for analyzing back links. And at least
the basic graph theory is not very hard.

Almost everything related to machine learning and artificial
intelligence is completely dependent on math. Math is the reason
amazon can suggest you relevant items, facebook can recognize you in
the photos, Google can give you more relevant results and [Siri][siri]
can understand you. Again, at least the basics of the math involved are
not that hard to understand.

The entire paradigm of functional programming originated in
mathematics. And as [Joel Spolsky says][joel-func-prog]

> Without understanding functional programming, you can't invent
> MapReduce, the algorithm that makes Google so massively
> scalable. The terms Map and Reduce come from Lisp and functional
> programming.[^1]

The world as you know it wouldn't exist without math. I think I can go
on an on about the utility of math. But I think I should present one
more side of the argument.

### Computer science thrives because of people who know math.

Notice how I didn't say "mathematicians" instead of "people who know math"?

Pretty much everyone who has made an impact in the field of computer
science is either a mathematician or at least knows math well.

As Steve so rightly suggests in [his post][Math-Every-Day], almost
everything that we associate with computer science originated with
John Von Neumann, who was primarily a mathematician. Have you ever
read this [wikipedia entry for John Von Neumann][von-neumann]? It's
mind boggling to think that a single person could do all of
that. Remember that all the commonly used computer architecture and
programming models are called
["Von Neumann Models"][von-neumann-arch].

[Alan Turing][turing], the man who formalized the concepts of
algorithms and computation with his Turing Machine and who is
generally considered to be the founder of theoretical computer science
and artificial intelligence, is also a mathematician.

[Donald Knuth][don-knuth], the "father" of algorithm analysis, is a
mathematician. You just can't analyze algorithms without math.

People like John McCarthy, Edsger Dijkstra, Alan Kay, Dennis Ritchie,
E. F. Codd, Richard Hamming, Rich Hickey, Tim Bray, Peter Norvig,
Niklaus Wirth, John Hopcroft, Fred Brooks Jr., Adi Shamir, Joe
Armstrong, Brian Kernighan, John Backus, Guido van Rossum, Stephen
Cole Kleene, Martin Odersky are all known to be either good at
mathematics or are actual mathematicians. This list can actually go on
for a while. And if you haven't heard of some of those, look them up;
be prepared to be impressed.

And if you think you never need to go to their levels, you could be
right. I know I am probably never going to reach their levels even if
I try. But that's not the point. The point is that math is the
ultimate tool that you can have in your toolbox. I prefer not to be
the man with only a hammer in his toolbox.

## What worked for me

The whole point of writing this post was to convey that it's possible
for everyday, run-of-the-mill programmers to learn math. Also, I
wanted to share some of the resources that I found very useful.

### Strategy

Stop taking math too seriously. Yes, math is supposed to
be rigorous, but that part comes after you become comfortable with it.

Read the following three articles and try to adapt the things Steve is
telling in his posts to your needs.

1. [Mathematicians are chronically lost and confused][mathemaicians-lost]:
   Jeremy Kun
2. [Math Every Day][Math-Every-Day]: Steve Yegge
3. [Math For Programmers][math-for-programmers]: Steve Yegge

### Online Resources

There are a lot of resources available online, but following are the
ones that I found to be the most useful.

1. [Mathematics Books](http://math-blog.com/mathematics-books/). This
   is a good collection of book titles by fields. Most of the
   suggested books are the de facto standards in those fields. I have
   purchased some of the math books based on this list (of course,
   after doing a lot more research on them).
2. [MIT OCW. Math for Computer Science][math-cs-mit]. This is
   the single best course that you can take for learning a lot of the
   stuff required for computer science. Number theory, graph theory,
   asymptotics and probability are included. The video lectures are
   amazing and they are accompanied by full lecture notes as well as
   problems and their solutions. Taking this course would be the
   biggest service you could do to yourself as far as math and
   programming are concerned.
3. [MIT OCW. Highlights of Calculus][math-calculus-mit]. Taught by the
   legendary Gilbert Strang, this is a super introduction to Calculus.
4. [Coursera. Calculus One][calc-one-coursera]. Taught by Jim
   Fowler, this is another amazing introduction to Calculus. The
   manner in which he teaches is infectiously enthusiastic.
5. [http://betterexplained.com/](http://betterexplained.com/). This is
   an amazing site with articles that explain a lot of math stuff in a
   very intuitive manner. Seriously, the guy who runs this site, Kalid
   Azad, has an amazing knack for teaching stuff in a way that just
   sticks in your brain.
6. [Ten Must Read Books about Mathematics][10-must-read-math]. A list
   of books that is not directly related to actual math, but are very
   interesting nonetheless. They can serve to deepen your interest in
   math even further. Also, they are a great tool to keep you from
   feeling guilty when you are not in the mood to do any actual
   math. Browse around this site and you will find a lot of
   interesting lists and other material related to math.

Of course, every time I go to [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
or
[MIT OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses/#mathematics)
sites, I feel like a kid in a candy store. So, as I said earlier,
choose whatever strikes your fancy.

### A few personal recommendations.

1. [What Is Mathematics][courant-math]. A superb portrait of the math
   universe, written in a very accessible manner. The chapters are
   largely independent of one another and all of them begin with some
   light material. I use it as leisure reading, jumping from topic to
   topic.
2. [Godel, Escher and Bach][geb]. One of the classics. This is
   tangential to the study of mathematics, but the ideas presented in
   this book do use quite a bit of math, in a very easy to understand
   manner. Read the reviews on Amazon or Goodreads.


## Conclusion

Using this strategy, so far, I have become quite comfortable with a
lot of topics in math. That includes the basics of number theory,
graph theory, and a lot of pre-calculus. I have just begun to
understand what calculus is all about. And I know what <i>sin</i>,
<i>cos</i> and the exponential constant <i>e</i> mean. I can even
solve a few problems using various types of induction.

Of course, even in these topics, I don't understand everything yet,
and I am okay with that. Not only because I *don't* need to understand
everything, but also because I am getting better every week.
