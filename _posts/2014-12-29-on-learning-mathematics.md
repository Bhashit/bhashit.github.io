On my last birthday, in September, I gifted myself a big stack of
mathematics books. All carefully chosen over a long period of
time. For past 4 years or so, I have been trying to get back into
learning math. And when I say "learning", I don't mean memorizing a
bunch of formulas. What I wanted to do was understand all the magical
stuff math seems to promise.

Ever since I could understand them, I have been both fascinated and
awed by mathematics (and physics).  Maybe that awe was the reason I
didn't start putting more efforts into learning math sooner; thinking
that the field is just too exotic and hard to be studied in part
time. Well, it might be if you want to become a professional
mathematician. I don't. It's more like a hobby for me; and if it helps
me professionally, all the better.

I started learning math sometime in 2010. A few hours every week. That
petered out in about 3 months. After that, sometime in 2012, I read a
post by Steve Yegge, titled [Math Every Day][Math-Every-Day] and
decided to try that strategy. At least half an hour everyday for
math. Considering that I was giving too much time to my job, this too
was ill fated and after a few weeks, I was back to no-math. There were
several occasions when I took up math on a weekend, determined to do
it every weekend. After one or two weekends, it just never happened.

The single biggest factor that was getting in the way was the fact
that I was trying to dive head first into math. Doing a lot of
exercises and learn everything about the given topic. Unless that's
your full time occupation, that is just never going to work out. It
leads to the frustrating feeling that you are not making any progress.

A few months ago, after leaving the job, I was getting desperate to
get back into math. This time, I decided to try out a different
strategy. One that I have been using successfully for a lot of other
things, but for some reason, never applied it to learning math. The
strategy was to take math like a hobby that it is. Not getting caught
up in too many details at once. The strategy was going to work
something like this:

1. Get a lot of books, including the paper ones if possible.
2. Find lots of online resources, including videos and articles.
3. From all of the above, pick whichever one that catches your fancy
   at the moment and start reading/watching.
4. If at any point, if you get tired or bored, pick another resource,
   or just go wild on Google/Wikipedia.
5. It's okay to learn things that are only tangential to math, like
   the history of math, or the story of prominent mathematicians,
   physicists and computer scientists.

Just around the same time I was diving into math, I came across a post
titled
["Mathematicians are Chronically lost and confused"][mathemaicians-lost]. It
said that all of the things that I had concluded were okay. Getting
lost and confused while getting into a large and seemingly infinite
field is alright. Then, to top it all off, I found another gem by
Steve Yegge. This one was titled
["Math For Programmers"][math-for-programmers]. I liked what these
guys said and got even more relaxed about learning math. That post by
Steve says pretty much every thing I could have said in this
post. It's just amazing.

I am a freelance programmer. I have a couple of friends who do
freelance work and we get together on a regular basis, sometime to
work together, sometime just to hang out. I knew that both of them
were interested in math so I suggested this idea to them and we
decided to put aside at least 4 hours every week for math. Now comes
the reason for writing this post. *The strategy works*. Just like it
worked for Steve Yegge, it worked for three ordinary programmers like
us. It's been about 4 months and we are even more motivated than we
were at the beginning. Math has now become a habit.

In September, I shared all the resources with them. We don't do it
like a class. I did suggest some possible pathways for learning, but
all of us do it at our own pace and liking. Now, we get together every
week. And every week, we exceed our quota of 4 hours; sometimes
by 5-6 hours. We are having a lot of fun.

In the process, I have gained a lot of confidence. Math doesn't seem
intractable anymore. I know that I won't be able to learn everything
about math, but I *will* be able to know a *lot of* useful and
incredible stuff.

## Why Do Programmers Need Math

If you read those Steve Yegge posts I mentioned above, I guess you
might have seen enough to answer that question. However, I still want
to present two more arguments.

### Math is literally everywhere

Pretty much all the technologies that make our lives better are either
aided by math or exist because of it.

Every single time you do anything that involves the use of encryption,
math is involved. More specifically, it's
[number theory][number-theory]. Every time you log in to facebook, buy
something on amazon, send a message on WhatsApp, do online banking, or
send money on PayPal, math is at work, making them secure. The basic
ideas behind this math are not that hard to understand.

When those [CDN][cdn] services deliver the content to you, the most
likely candidate for optimizing that experience is
[graph theory][graph-theory]. Pretty much all of the popular services,
including facebook, Apple iTunes store, Microsoft, Rackspace, Adobe,
NASA, Yahoo, Airbnb etc. use CDNs to deliver data faster to you.

The reason Google (and now pretty much every search engine) is so
successful at finding relevant result is the use of
[graph theory][graph-theory] for analyzing back links. And at least
the basic graph theory is not very hard.

Almost everything related to machine learning and artificial
intelligence is completely dependent on math. Math is the reason
amazon can suggest you relevant items, facebook can recognize you in
the photos, Google can give you more relevant results and [Siri][siri]
can understand you. Again, at least the basics of the math involved are
not that hard to understand.

The entire paradigm of functional programming originated in
mathematics. And as [Joel Spolsky says][joel-func-prog]

> Without understanding functional programming, you can't invent
> MapReduce, the algorithm that makes Google so massively
> scalable. The terms Map and Reduce come from Lisp and functional
> programming.[^1]

The world as we know it wouldn't exist without math. I think I can go
on and on about the utility of math. But let me get to the second
argument.

### Computer science thrives because of people who know math.

Notice how I didn't say "mathematicians" instead of "people who know math"?

Pretty much everyone who has made an impact in the field of computer
science is either a mathematician or at least knows math well.

As Steve so rightly suggests in [his post][Math-Every-Day], almost
everything that we associate with computer science originated with
John Von Neumann, who was primarily a mathematician. Have you ever
read this [wikipedia entry for John Von Neumann][von-neumann]? It's
mind boggling to think that a single person could do all of
that. Remember that all the commonly used computer architecture and
programming models are called
["Von Neumann Models"][von-neumann-arch].

[Alan Turing][turing], the man who formalized the concepts of
algorithms and computation with his Turing Machine and who is
generally considered to be the founder of theoretical computer science
and artificial intelligence, is also a mathematician.

[Donald Knuth][don-knuth], the "father" of algorithm analysis, is a
mathematician. You just can't analyze algorithms without math.

People like John McCarthy, Edsger Dijkstra, Alan Kay, Dennis Ritchie,
E. F. Codd, Richard Hamming, Rich Hickey, Tim Bray, Peter Norvig,
Niklaus Wirth, John Hopcroft, Fred Brooks Jr., Adi Shamir, Joe
Armstrong, Brian Kernighan, John Backus, Guido van Rossum, Stephen
Cole Kleene, Martin Odersky are all known to be either good at
mathematics or are actual mathematicians. This list can actually go on
for a while. And if you haven't heard of some of those, look them up;
be prepared to be impressed.

And if you think you never need to go to their levels, you could be
right. I know I am probably never going to reach their levels even if
I try. But that's not the point. The point is that math is the
ultimate tool that you can have in your toolbox. It's the one ring
that rules them all, combined with the lightsaber.


## What worked for me

The whole point of writing this post was to convey that it's possible
for everyday, run-of-the-mill programmers like me to learn math. Also,
I wanted to share some of the resources that I found very useful.

### The idea

Stop taking math too seriously. Yes, math is supposed to
be rigorous, but that part comes after you become comfortable with it.

Read these articles and try to adapt the things Steve is telling in
his posts to your needs.

1. [Mathematicians are chronically lost and confused][mathemaicians-lost]:
   Jeremy Kun
2. [Math Every Day][Math-Every-Day]: Steve Yegge
3. [Math For Programmers][math-for-programmers]: Steve Yegge

Try hard things and try easy things. When you get stuck, jump
somewhere else and come back to it later, after you brain had some
time to get adjusted to the new ideas. If you read something that you
don't fully understand, you might still be able to grasp the central
ideas there. And even if you don't see the big picture right away,
keep digging around and when the time is right, the brain will connect
all the dots for you. **Do not ever** fall into the trap that you need
to grok something right away, unless your job depends on it.

### Online Resources

There are a lot of resources available online, but following are the
ones that I found to be the most useful.

1. [Mathematics Books](http://math-blog.com/mathematics-books/). This
   is a good collection of book titles by fields. Most of the
   suggested books are the de facto standards in those fields. I have
   purchased some of the math books based on this list (of course,
   after doing a lot more research on them).
2. [MIT OCW. Math for Computer Science][math-cs-mit]. This is the
   single best course that you can take for learning a lot of the
   stuff required for computer science. The course includes number
   theory, graph theory, asymptotics and probability. The video
   lectures are amazing and they are accompanied by full lecture notes
   as well as problems and their solutions. Taking this course would
   be the single biggest service you could do to yourself as far as
   math and programming are concerned.
3. [MIT OCW. Highlights of Calculus][math-calculus-mit]. Taught by the
   legendary Gilbert Strang, this is a great introduction to Calculus.
4. [Coursera. Calculus One][calc-one-coursera]. Taught by Jim Fowler,
   this is another amazing introduction to calculus. Jim Fowler is
   infectiously enthusiastic about calculus.
5. [http://betterexplained.com/](http://betterexplained.com/). This is
   an amazing site with articles that explain a lot of math stuff in a
   very intuitive manner. The guy who runs this site, Kalid Azad, has
   an amazing knack for teaching stuff in a way that just sticks in
   your brain.
6. [Ten Must Read Books about Mathematics][10-must-read-math]. A list
   of books that is not directly related to actual math, but are very
   interesting nonetheless. They can serve to deepen your interest in
   math even further. Also, they are a great tool to keep you from
   feeling guilty when you are not in the mood to do any actual
   math. Browse around this site and you will find a lot of
   interesting lists and other material related to math.

Visiting [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) or
[MIT OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/audio-video-courses/#mathematics)
makes me feel like a kid in a candy store, even though I prefer books
to videos. You can start with whatever seems most interesting, even if it seems
hard.

### A few other recommendations.

1. [What Is Mathematics][courant-math]. A superb portrait of the math
   universe, written in a very accessible manner. The chapters are
   largely independent of one another and all of them begin with some
   light material. I use it as leisure reading, jumping from topic to
   topic.
2. [Godel, Escher and Bach][geb]. This is tangential to the study of
   mathematics, but the ideas presented in this book do explain some
   really fundamental stuff about math; things like the difference
   between the symbols and their interpretations, or why no powerful
   mathematical system can be complete and consistent. Even with all
   that serious stuff, the book is virtually unputdownable. Read some
   of the reviews on Goodreads or Amazon.
3. [Vi Hart's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart):
   Vi Hart is a self-described "recreational mathemusician". Her
   videos are incredibly fun, informative and insightful, all at the
   same time.

## Conclusion

So far, I have become quite comfortable with a lot of topics in
math. That includes number theory, graph theory, and almost all of
pre-calculus. I have just begun to understand what calculus is all
about. And I know what <i>sin</i>, <i>cos</i> and the exponential
constant <i>e</i> mean. I can even solve a few problems using various
types of induction.

Of course, even in these topics, I don't understand everything yet,
and I am okay with that. Not only because I *don't* need to understand
everything, but also because I am getting better every week.
