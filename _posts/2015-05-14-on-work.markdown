When I left my job to try some new stuff (build a product), I got some decent investment
offers, but I decided that doing some consulting work to sustain
myself was better when I didn't even have a concrete plan. My ideas
for a product didn't quite materialize since I gradually started
losing my excitement for them.  realized that I just wasn't
entrepreneur material. 

Meanwhile, I was also getting some decent projects to work on as a
freelancer. I have worked on some really great projects and I've had a
lot of fun. After some time, I started getting more and more offers
for work, which is great, by the way. Especially because I get to
choose which projects to work on without having to worry about how I'd
pay for my next book from Amazon. Which means that I let some of those
projects go by. I'm not running a consultancy to offload that
work. Which also means that I'm not earning as much as I could. On the
other hand, whatever time I get in exchange for that, I spend it on
other things that I want to do. In last one year, I started traveling
more, I am reading and learning more, and I even started this, however
badly written, blog.

At least in India, leaving your well-paying job is still not a
norm. The question of finances sometimes comes up while talking with
friends or relatives. And I ended up mentioning that I wasn't taking
up some projects that could pay more money. When this comes up, I am
sometimes told that I should accept those projects, regardless of
whether or not I'd enjoy them, so that I can retire early and do those
other things later. I think I understand the idea behind this. I
understand that we want to wrap things up and then have some leisure
time without any distractions. Nice, clean breaks. That's probably why
I think everyone starts getting into a bad mood on the last day of the
vacation, or even the Sunday evenings.

I have decided, despite all the stuff my brain throws at me, fears and
insecurities, that this might not be a really great idea. It doesn't
work apparently, based on what I have seen so far.

But the main thing is that I don't want to retire. Regardless of how
boring the work sometimes gets, and it does get boring sometimes. I
get a lot of satisfaction from the better parts of my work. I also
think that most of my confidence comes only from doing good,
productive work, and that confidence spills into all the other areas
in my life.

Too much of *non-productive* time also begins to feel a little
boring. And by productive, *I just don't mean earning money*. It could
be anything, like learning math, learning to invest, teaching, 
or even writing a blog post, or just thinking about
something you read. People who have a lot of free time are the people
who are waiting for the updates of the like-count on their facebook
posts. These are the people who become dependent on others to build
their confidence. And it's always a disaster. 

When people are overworked, I think they dream of running away from it
all, permanently. I think most of them underestimate how much their
work contributes to their overall happiness. Even if it's a crappy
job, I know people who do it well enough and find ways out of it or
make it worthwhile. And as the legendary geek Amar
Bose [said][amar-bose], job is what you make it[^1].

I know how important money is. I even grew up on Ayn Rand[^2]. I have
been spending quite a bit of time to learn investing; By going through
several books, a lot of statistics and a microeconomics course. Doing
something that pays your bills is extremely important. And no matter
what your hobbies are, be it climbing the Everest, or trolling others
on the internet, everything costs money. So, I have no delusions about
that. All I am saying is that hoarding money so that you can retire
comfortably and sail into the sunset is a dream
that generally fails to materialize.

This is also **not** an argument against hard work. I think hard work
is fun, and deeply satisfying. Most of the time, whenever I've had to
push myself hard to get something done, it has always been a
pleasure. I have worked through weekends, stayed long nights and
logged 60 hours of work on 40 hour contracts. Those have always been
good times, and the end results have been fulfilling.  Good work, and
the subsequent feeling of accomplishment, is probably the biggest
thing contributing to my happiness.

When I say that I don't want to retire, I don't mean to say that I
will always continue to be a programmer. I think that will depend on a
lot of factors. It might get old. And the world is changing too fast
to make that kind of plans over a 5 year horizon. Although, it does
look like programming will continue to fit the bill for the
foreseeable future. It continues to be challenging and there are
always new, exciting things to learn and do, and it pays reasonably
well.

However, when that inevitable robot revolution comes in 2045, things
may get out of hand. It could end well, and we may live in peace with
the robots. And in that scenario, maybe I'll take up a teaching job
because I obviously won't be able to compete with the robots in
programming; specifically because they would be able to sit in the
same chair for a week straight, unlike me, who would have to get up
every hour to stretch my human legs. They also wouldn't need to spend
time on reddit arguing over whether to use vi or emacs because they
wouldn't even need a text editor, let alone syntax highlighting or
auto completion. I am resting my hopes on the idea that the kids
wouldn't want to be taught by the robots who took away their parents'
jobs.  If it's a dystopian world, ala The Matrix, maybe Morpheus will
pick me up to fix the shitty parts on the Nebuchandnezzar; and I'll be
ready for that since I'm learning to do some mechanic work.

The point is, I don't want to make that doomed-to-fail plan where I
work on whatever pays the most money for 20 years, hoping for a happy
retirement. I want to keep working for as long as I can. But I mostly
want to choose work based on its quality, rather than the size of the
paycheck. I'm okay with a little less money. My leisure time mostly
involves traveling, reading or learning some new stuff. And since all
of that requires at least some mental and physical abilities, I guess
I'll be able to work for them as long as it's possible for me to enjoy
them. After that, [I wouldn't care][being-mortal].

## Footnotes

[^1]: If you haven't seen [that video][amar-bose] yet, I highly
    recommend you do so. For one, Amar Bose is one ultimate
    nerd. The reflections are priceless. It's actually so good, I was
    tempted to take that entire course in acoustics. You can ignore
    the first few minutes probably where he does a demo of an
    acoustics problem. The rest is, I repeat, priceless.

[^2]: I know her fiction work involves some really lame
    stuff. But the central ideas about fair
    exchange of values and the inevitability of reality are solid.
