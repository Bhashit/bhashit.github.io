                        Suppose an investor buys land in a rural area
                        for $1500 an acre and sells some of it 5 years later at $3000 an acre
                        and the rest of it 10 years later at $6000. Write a function that
                        models the value of land in that area, assuming the growth rate stays
                        the same. What would the expected cost per acre be 30 years after the
                        initial investment of $1500?

                        Exponential functions can be used to model the concentration of a
                        drug in a patient’s body. Suppose the concentration of Drug X in a
                        patient’s bloodstream is modeled by
                        $$
                        C(t) = C_0 e^{-rt}
                        $$
                        where ## C(t) ## represents the concentration at time ## t ## (in hours),
                        ## C_0 ## is the concentration of the drug in the blood immediately after
                        injection, and ## r \gt 0 ## is a constant indicating the removal of the
                        drug by the body through metabolism and/or excretion. The rate
                        constant ## r ## has units of ## 1/time ## (1/hr). It is important to note that
                        this model assumes that the blood concentration of the drug ## C_0 ##
                        peaks immediately when the drug is injected.

                        <strong>Exercise: </strong>After an injection of Drug Y, the
                        concentration of the drug in the bloodstream drops at the
                        rate of 0.020 1/hr. Find the concentration, to the nearest
                        tenth, of the drug 20 hours after receiving an injection with
                        initial concentration of 5.0 mg/L.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Statement. Given any collection of n blonde girls. If at least one of the girls has blue eyes,
                                then all n of them have blue eyes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Proof." The statement is obviously true when n = 1. The step from k to k + 1 can
                                be illustrated by going from n = 3 to n = 4. Assume, therefore, that the statement is true
                                when n = 3 and let G1 G2, G3, G4 be four blonde girls, at least one of which, say G1 has blue
                                eyes. Taking G1, G2, and G3 together and using the fact that the statement is true when n = 3,
                                we find that G2 and G3 also have blue eyes. Repeating the process with G1, G2, and G4, we find
                                that G4 has blue eyes. Thus all four have blue eyes. A similar argument allows us to make
                                the step from k to k + 1 in general.
                                Corollary. All blonde girls have blue eyes.
                                Proof. Since there exists at least one blonde girl with blue eyes, we can apply the foregoing
                                result to the collection consisting of all blonde girls.
                                Note: This example is from G. Polya, who suggests that the reader may want to test the
                                validity of the statement by experiment.
